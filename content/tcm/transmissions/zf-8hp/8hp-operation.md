## Gear Sequencing
In the ZF 8HP there are **five** actuated elements:
 - 2x multidisc brakes (A and B)
 - 3x multidisc clutch packs (C, D and E). 
 
 By engaging different combinations of these elements the transmission obtains each of its eight forward ratios (plus reverse). Below is the engagement map (columns = Gears R, 1–8; ✓ = element applied):

| Gear | Brake A | Brake B | Clutch C | Clutch D | Clutch E |
| ---- | :-----: | :-----: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| R    |    ✓    |    ✓    |     –    |     ✓    |     –    |
| 1    |    ✓    |    ✓    |     ✓    |     –    |     –    |
| 2    |    ✓    |    ✓    |     –    |     –    |     ✓    |
| 3    |    –    |    ✓    |     ✓    |     –    |     ✓    |
| 4    |    –    |    ✓    |     –    |     ✓    |     ✓    |
| 5    |    –    |    ✓    |     ✓    |     ✓    |     –    |
| 6    |    –    |    –    |     ✓    |     ✓    |     ✓    |
| 7    |    ✓    |    –    |     ✓    |     ✓    |     –    |
| 8    |    ✓    |    –    |     –    |     ✓    |     ✓    |

 - **Brake A** blocks the double‐sun gears (S₁/S₂).
 - **Brake B** blocks the ring gear of the first planetary set (R₁).
 - **Clutch C** connects the torque-converter output to the ring gear of gearset 3/sun gear of gearset 4 (R₃/S₄).
 - **Clutch D** ties the carriers of gearsets 3 and 4 (C₃→C₄).
 - **Clutch E** links the ring/sun elements between gearsets 2 and 3 (R₂/S₃→R₃/S₄). ([en.wikipedia.org][1])

## Changing Gears
When the 8HP shifts from one gear to another, the transmission’s mechatronic control unit must orchestrate a precise, synchronized pressure “dance” between the off-going and on-coming elements (clutches or brakes) so that torque is transferred smoothly and without interruption or shock.  Broadly speaking, each shift follows a three-phase pressure profile:

1. **Fill (Charge) Phase**
   – The on-coming clutch (or brake) is rapidly charged from zero up to a calibrated “fill” pressure.  This ensures the friction pack has just enough clamp force to begin carrying torque without dragging on the off-going element.
   – The duration of this fill phase (“fill time”) and the initial fill pressure are adaptive parameters the TCU learns and adjusts continuously to compensate for wear, fluid temperature, and oil condition ([8speed AU][1]).

2. **Torque (Ramping) Phase**
   – Once the on-coming element has reached fill pressure, the TCU simultaneously ramps the on-coming pressure **up** and the off-going pressure **down** at matched, linear (or trapezoidal) rates.  By doing this, the net clutch capacity tracks the engine’s torque demand multiplied by the new gear ratio, avoiding both “flare” (too little on-coming pressure) and “tie-up” (too little off-going release).
   – These ramp rates are defined in the shift pressure tables (e.g. ZF00605 for on-coming apply and ZF00569 for off-going release during a downshift) and can be fine-tuned for shift firmness or smoothness ([PCMTEC Forums][2]).

3. **Completion (Hold) Phase**
   – After torque transfer is complete, the off-going element’s pressure is bled out fully (to zero), freeing it entirely, while the on-coming element’s pressure continues up to its final apply value to lock in the new gear.
   – A brief “holding” sub-phase may be used to stabilize pressure before committing to full apply, further smoothing the engagement.

**Key takeaways:**

* **Synchronized ramping** of apply and release pressures is crucial: the slope of the off-going pressure decline must match the on-coming pressure rise so that the transmission’s net torque path never drops out or spikes.
* **Adaptive tuning** of fill times and ramp rates keeps shifts crisp and compensates for wear or fluid changes over the life of the transmission.
* **Valve hardware** (apply vs. bleed circuits) is sized to support the required ramp rates without hydraulic lag.

By carefully profiling these pressure ramps, ZF’s 8HP achieves its hallmark—ultra-fast, yet smooth, clutch-to-clutch shifts.
